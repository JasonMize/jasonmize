    <h1>Why This Site?</h1>

      <p>
        I am interested in things.  Some of them intersect.  Some of them don't.
      </p>
      <p>
        Let me stop there and be very clear.  Let me be direct.  
      </p>
      <p>
        This is not a blog.  
        I don't like blogs - though I do enjoy writing and I love to read.
        I am a fan of literature.  I love fiction.  
        I can take sci-fi home and read it until I'm bleary eyed and 
        heavy with sleep.  But I don't understand blogs.
      </p>
      <p>
        So this is not a blog.
      </p>
      <p>
        We may have to discover what it is together.
      </p>
      <p>      
        A showcase?  I suppose?  A little shelf on the dining room wall of the internet where 
        I prop up my curios?  Hmmm.  Honestly, I find that idea vaguely distastful.  
        A triffle tawdry.  A tad desperate.  
      </p>
      <p>
        However...
        I have an ever increasing need to display.  To be seen.  Maybe that IS tawdry.  An ugly truth.
        I want to put on rooftop concerts and take up theater.  I want to 
        dance publicly and with great abandon.  I get vague ideas about 
        grafitti when I see spray cans.  I don't want to write, I want to monologue.  
      </p>
      <p>
        The internet is almost as good a way of getting my ideas in front of the public 
        as posting them in an envelope which I then set fire to. I know this.
        But it doesn't seem to be enough to simply make things.  The things want more than 
        simply to be made.  
      </p>
      <p>
        This will have to do.
      </p>
      <p>
        Maybe it will help.
      </p>
